Building Blocks:
To construct our hostel management system, we’ll utilize the power of Python, a versatile and easy-to-learn programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Python’s extensive libraries and frameworks make it an ideal choice for developing a wide range of applications, including GUI-based ones. With the help of a GUI framework like Tkinter or PyQt, we can create a visually appealing interface that simplifies interactions for users.

Key Features:
Our hostel management system will encompass essential features such as adding students, allocating rooms, tracking in-time and out-time, managing visitors, viewing student information, and processing leave applications. Each feature is designed to address specific needs of hostel administration, facilitating smooth operations and effective management.

How to Run the Code:

To run the Python code for the hostel management system, follow these steps:
Create a Folder: Choose a name for your project and create a folder with that name on your computer. This folder will contain all the files related to the hostel management system.
Create a Python File: Inside the folder, create a new Python file named main.py. You can do this by right-clicking within the folder, selecting “New” or “Create New”, and then choosing “Python File” or simply “File” depending on your operating system and text editor.
Paste the Code: Open the main.py file in a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice. Copy the Python code provided for the hostel management system and paste it into the main.py file.
Save the File: After pasting the code, save the main.py file.
Run the Code: Open a terminal or command prompt window and navigate to the folder where you saved the main.py file. You can do this using the cd command (change directory) followed by the path to your folder.
Execute the Python Script: Once you’re in the correct directory, type python main.py and press Enter to run the Python script. This will execute the code and launch the hostel management system.
